## Problem:

   "Unguided freshers lead to wrong direction"
   * No platform exist where freshers or undergraduate can interact with seniors, alumni, professors of respective institute. College being conducted virtually these days, such       a platform is dire need of the new students, so that they can find mentors for themselves and set-up their future goals. 
   * A Quizzing platform to prevent or reduce cheating unlike other various platforms is a dire need of professors and quizzing communities.


## Proposed Solution:


   Problem 1 Solution: 
   
   * The main objective of our hack was to build a bridge between juniors, seniors, alumni and professors of institute.
   
   * Our platform will help them interact (using messaging and video calling) with each other or post queries in post section under various categories.
   
   
   Problem 2 Solution: 
   
   * Our platform provides features to conduct quizzes with live leaderboard.
   
   * Every question is once attemptable and can't be retrieved back after answering once. Hence the cheating is prevented.
   
   * Quizzes can be conducted and attempted by students in various fields like academics, job oriented, etc. 


## Wow Factor:

* A new post can be saved as a draft before posting it online.
* All the quizzes are timed, once the timer runs down, the Quiz get auto submitted irrespective of your responses.
* People can be searched on the basis of the tags(fresher, sophomore, junior, senior) to lookup for mentors or to act as mentors.
* Disabled Screenshot during Quizzes to prevent sharing of answers.






## Future Work:

* Provide notifications of messages, phone calls, post likes/comments, upcoming quizzes.

* Categorize people on the basis of their area of interests/expertise.

* Add an e-library support for study resources and materials.

* Upload Resume and job listings.
